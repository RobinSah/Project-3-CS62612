Egg Dropping Problem

Given m eggs and an n-floor building, we need to figure out the highest floor an egg can be dropped without breaking, assuming: i) All eggs are identical. ii) If an egg breaks after being dropped from one floor, then the egg will also break if dropped from all higher floors. iii) If an egg does not break after being thrown from a certain floor, it retains all of its strength, and you can continue to use that egg. 
Objective: Minimize the number of throws.
